# The-Science-of-Cinema-Predicting-Movie-Ratings-Through-Data

This project aims to predict the rating category of a movie based on various features such as director popularity, budget, runtime, genre, and more. 

## Dataset

The project uses a movie ratings dataset (movie_ratings_dataset.csv) containing information about movies and their corresponding ratings.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis:** The dataset is explored to understand its structure, features, and target variable. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to identify patterns and insights.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Missing values are imputed, categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are scaled to prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Model Selection and Training:** Several classification models are trained, including Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC score.
5. **Visualization:** The results are visualized using bar charts and heatmaps to compare model performance.

## Results

The project compares the performance of different classification models and identifies the best-performing model for movie rating prediction.

## Usage

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
